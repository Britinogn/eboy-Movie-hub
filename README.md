## Quick Start
> This project is a simple Vue 3 app (with Vite) that shows upcoming movies.  
> Check `src/pages/dashboard.vue` for the main movie listing logic.

> **Note:**  
> This project fetches upcoming movies from a remote API and displays them grouped by date.  
> - The main logic for fetching and displaying movies is in `src/pages/dashboard.vue`.
> - API calls are handled in `src/services/api.js`.
> - The UI uses Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
> - To run the project, install dependencies with `npm install` and start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
